<p>In the year 1769 was printed an inaugural dissertation, intituled,
“<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Observationes ad vires Theæ pertinentes.</cite>”</p>

<p>In the year 1772 was published, “<cite>The Natural History of
the Tea tree, with Observations on the Medical Qualities of
Tea, and Effects of Tea-drinking</cite>,” which not only contained
a translation of the Thesis, but likewise the natural history of
this vegetable, and which having been long out of print, it was
thought a second edition would be favourably received by the
publick.</p>

<p>In Sir George Staunton’s <cite>Embassy to China</cite>, lately published,
there are some remarks on Tea, which are occasionally referred
to in the present edition; and they are referred to with the
satisfaction of confirming the relation first offered to the publick
in 1772.</p>

<p>As the Preface inserted at that time affords some hints respecting
the introduction of the Tea-tree into Europe, it is prefixed
to the present edition.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs100"><span class="gesperrt">THE FIRST EDITION</span>, 1772.</p>


<p class="p2">The subject of the following Essay being now in general
use among the inhabitants of this kingdom, as well as in many
other parts of Europe, and constituting a large part of our commerce,
it cannot but afford pleasure to the curious to possess
the history of a shrub, with the leaves of which they are so well
acquainted.</p>

<p>Many treatises have been published on the uses and effects of
Tea; a few writers have likewise given some circumstances relative
to its natural history and preparation, the indefatigable
Kæmpfer particularly; but these circumstances lie so dispersed,
and the accounts which have been given of the virtues and
efficacy of Tea are in general so contradictory, and void of true
medical observation, that it still seemed no improper subject for
a candid discussion. The reader may at least have the satisfaction
of seeing, in a narrow compass, the principal opinions
relative to this subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span></p>

<p>Within these three or four years we have been successful
enough to introduce into this kingdom a few genuine Tea plants.
There was formerly, I am told, a very large one in England,
the property of an East-India captain, who kept it some years,
and refused to part with either cuttings or layers. This died,
and there was not another left in the kingdom. A large plant
was not long since in the possession of the great Linnæus, but,
I am informed, it is now dead. I know several gentlemen,
who have spared neither pains nor expence to procure this ever-green
from China; but their best endeavours have, in general,
proved unsuccessful. For, though many strong and good plants
were shipped at Canton, and all possible care taken of them
during the voyage, yet they soon grew sickly, and but one, till
of late, survived the passage to England.</p>

<p>The largest Tea plant in this kingdom is, I believe, at Kew;
it was presented to that royal seminary by John Ellis, Esq. who
raised it from the seed. But the plant at Sion-house, belonging
to the Duke of Northumberland, is the first that ever
flowered in Europe; and an elegant drawing has been taken
from it in that state, with its botanical description. The engraver
has done justice to his original drawing, which is now in
the possession of that great promoter of natural history, Dr.
Fothergill, to whom I have been indebted for many dried specimens
and flowers of the Tea-tree from China. If the reader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
compare this plate with the following description, he will have
as clear an idea of this exotic shrub, as can at present be exhibited.</p>

<p>A few young Tea plants have lately been introduced into
some of the most curious botanic gardens about London; hence
it seems probable that this very distinguished vegetable will become
a denizen of England, and such of her colonies as may
be deemed most favourable to its propagation.</p>

<p>In regard to the effects of Tea on the human constitution, one
might have imagined that long and general use would have furnished
so many indisputable proofs of its good and bad properties,
that nothing could be easier than to determine these with precision:
yet so difficult a thing is it to establish physical certainty in regard
to the operation of food or medicines on the human body, that
our knowledge in general, even with respect to this article, is
very imperfect. Nevertheless, I have endeavoured to avail
myself of what has been written on this subject by my predecessors
with the appearance of reason, as well as of the conversation
of learned and ingenious men now living, together
with such experiments and observations as have occurred to me,
so as to furnish the means of a more extensive knowledge of the
subject.</p>

has enabled me to enlarge it with some important additions.
Since the period of the original publication, the Tea-tree has
been introduced into many of our gardens, and afforded the
means of ascertaining its botanical characters. I have, at the
same time, the pleasure to observe, that the first edition has
received the approbation of some of the most distinguished
botanists. Linnæus, as well as Haller, as soon as they had perused
it, conveyed to me their approbation, in the kindest manner:
Murray and Cullen, and recently Schreber, have made frequent
references to its authorities. If these distinguished characters
have approved the former, I am encouraged to hope that the
present edition will not be less favourably received by the
publick.</p>

<p>In the Acta Haffniensia, we meet with the first figure of this
tree; but, as it was taken from a dried specimen, it does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
illustrate the subject very well. Bontius published another, and
though drawn in India, where he might have seen the plant, it
does not much surpass the preceding. The figure given by
Plukenet is better than either of the former; and after his,
Breynius published one still better: but of all the engravings formerly
executed, that given by Kæmpfer must be allowed to be
the most accurate<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; yet even this icon, like all the others published
by this industrious naturalist, is extremely imperfect; although
he certainly saw the living plants which he has represented,
however expert the Chinese may be in deception<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">ORIGIN OF TEA.</span></h3>


<p>As China and Japan<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> are the only countries known to
us, where the Tea shrub is cultivated for use, we may reasonably
conclude, that it is indigenous to one of them, if not to both.
What motive first led the natives to use an infusion of Tea in
the present manner is uncertain; but probably in order to correct
the water, which is said to be brackish and ill-tasted in
many parts of those countries<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. Of the good effects of Tea in
such cases, we have a remarkable proof in Kalm’s journey
through North America, which his translator gives us in the
following words:</p>

<p>“Tea is differently esteemed by different people, and I
think we <em>would</em> be as well, and our purses much better, if we
were without tea and coffee. However, I must be impartial,
and mention in praise of Tea, that if it be useful, it must certainly
be so in summer, on such journies as mine, through a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
desart country, where one cannot carry wine, or other liquors,
and where the water is generally unfit for use, as being full
of insects. In such cases it is very pleasant when boiled, and
Tea is drank with it; and I cannot sufficiently describe the fine
taste it has in such circumstances. It relieves a weary traveller
more than can be imagined, as I have myself experienced, together
with a great many others, who have travelled through
the desart forests of America: on such journies Tea is found to
be almost as necessary as victuals<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.”</p>

<p>About the year 1600, Texeira, a Spaniard, saw the dried
Tea leaves in Malacca, where he was informed that the Chinese
prepared a drink from this vegetable; and, in 1633, Olearius
found this practice prevalent among the Persians, who procured
the plant under the name of Cha orchia, from China, by
means of the Usbeck Tartars. In 1639, Starkaw, the Russian
Ambassador, at the Court of the Mogul, Chau Altyn, partook
of the infusion of Tea; and, at his departure, was offered a
quantity of it, as a present for the Czar Michael Romanof,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
which the Ambassador refused, as being an article for which he
had no use<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>This article was first introduced into Europe by the Dutch
East India Company, very early in the last century; and a
quantity of it was brought over from Holland about the year
1666<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, by Lord Arlington and Lord Ossory. In consequence
of this, Tea soon became known amongst people of fashion, and
its use, by degrees, since that period, has become general.</p>

<p>It is, however, certain, that before this time, drinking Tea,
even in public coffee-houses, was not uncommon; for, in 1660,
a duty of four-pence per gallon was laid on the liquor made and
sold in all coffee-houses<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>So early as 1678, Cornelius Bontekoe, a Dutch physician,
published a treatise, in his own language, on Tea, Coffee, and
Chocolate<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. In this he shews himself a very zealous advocate
for Tea, and denies the possibility of its injuring the stomach,
although taken to the greatest excess, as far as one or two hundred
cups in a day. To what motive we are to impute the partiality
of Dr. Bontekoe, is uncertain at this period; but as he
was first physician to the Elector of Brandenburgh, and probably
of considerable eminence and character, his eulogium might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
tend greatly to promote its use: however, we find its importation
and consumption were daily augmented; and, before the
conclusion of the last century, it became generally known
among the common people in England.</p>

<p>It is foreign to my subject, or it would perhaps afford to a
speculative mind no inconsiderable satisfaction, to trace the
consumption from its first entrance at the Custom-house to the
present amazing imports. At this time upwards of twenty-three
millions of pounds are annually allowed for home consumption;
and the East India Company have generally in their warehouses
a supply at least for one year.</p>

<p>The following account of the importation of Tea, from 1776
to 1795, as related by Sir George Staunton (Vol. II. p. 624),
may be satisfactory to the Reader:</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">SOIL AND CULTURE.</span></h3>


<p>To the ingenious Kæmpfer we are principally indebted for
any accurate information respecting the culture of the Tea Tree;
and, as his account was composed during his residence at Japan,
greater credit is certainly due to it. We shall give what he
says upon this subject, and then state the accounts we have
been able to collect of the Chinese method.</p>

<p>Kæmpfer tells us, that no particular gardens or fields are
allotted for this plant, but that it is cultivated round the borders
of rice and corn fields, without any regard to the soil. Any
number of the seeds, as they are contained in their seed vessels,
not usually less than six, or exceeding twelve or fifteen, are
promiscuously put into one hole, made four or five inches deep
in the ground, at certain distances from each other. The seeds
contain a large proportion of oil, which is soon liable to turn
rancid; hence scarce a fifth part of them germinate, and this
makes it necessary to plant so many together.</p>

<p>The seeds vegetate without any other care; but the more
industrious annually remove the weeds, and manure the land.
The leaves which succeed are not fit to be plucked before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
third year’s growth, at which period they are plentiful, and in
their prime.</p>

<p>In about seven years the shrub rises to a man’s height; but
as it then bears few leaves, and grows slowly, it is cut down to
the stem, which occasions such an exuberance of fresh shoots
and leaves the succeeding summer, as abundantly compensates
the owners for their former loss and trouble. Some defer
cutting them till they are of ten years growth.</p>

<p>So far as can be gathered from authors and travellers of
credit, this shrub is cultivated and prepared in China, in a
similar manner to what is practised in Japan; but as the Chinese
export considerable quantities of Tea, they plant whole fields
with it, to supply foreign markets, as well as for home consumption.</p>

<p>The Tea-tree delights particularly in vallies; or on the declivities
of hills, and upon the banks of rivers, where it enjoys
a southern exposure to the sun; though it endures considerable
variations of heat and cold, as it flourishes in the northern
clime of Pekin, as well as about Canton<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, the former of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
which is in the same latitude with Rome; and from meteorological
observations it appears, that the degree of cold about
Pekin is as severe in winter, as in some of the northern parts
of Europe<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">GATHERING THE LEAVES.</span></h3>


<p>At the proper seasons for gathering the Tea leaves, labourers
are hired, who are very quick in plucking them, being
accustomed to follow this employment as a means of their livelihood.
They do not pluck them by handfuls, but carefully
one by one; and, tedious as this may appear, each person is
able to collect from four to ten or fifteen pounds in one day.
The different periods in which the leaves are usually gathered,
are particularly described by Kæmpfer<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>I. The first commences at the middle of the last moon, immediately
preceding the vernal equinox, which is the first month
of the Japanese year, and falls about the latter end of our
February, or beginning of March. The leaves collected at
this time are called Ficki Tsjaa, or powdered Tea, because
they are pulverised and sipped in hot water (<span class="smcap">Sect. IX. I</span>).
These tender young leaves are but a few days old when they
are plucked; and, because of their scarcity and price, are
disposed of to princes and rich people only; and hence this
kind is called Imperial Tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>A similar sort is also called Udsi Tsjaa, and Tacke Sacki
Tsjaa, from the particular places where it grows. The peculiar
care and nicety observed in gathering the Tea leaves in these
places deserve to be noticed here, and we shall therefore give
some account of one of them.</p>

<p>Udsi is a small Japanese town, bordering on the sea, and not
far distant from the city of Miaco. In the district of this little
town, is a pleasant mountain of the same name, which is
thought to possess the most favourable soil and climate for the
culture of Tea, on which account it is inclosed with hedges,
and likewise surrounded with a broad ditch for farther security.
The trees are planted upon this mountain in such a manner as
to form regular rows, with intervening walks. Persons are appointed
to superintend the place, and preserve the leaves from
injury or dirt. The labourers who are to gather them, for some
weeks before they begin, abstain from every kind of gross food,
or whatever might endanger communicating any ill flavour to
the leaves; they pluck them also with the same delicacy,
having on a thin pair of gloves<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. This sort of imperial or
bloom Tea<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> is afterwards prepared, and then escorted by the
chief surveyor of the works of this mountain, with a strong
guard, and a numerous retinue, to the emperor’s court, for
the use of the Imperial family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>II. The second gathering is made in the second Japanese
month, about the latter end of March, or beginning of April.
Some of the leaves at this period are come to perfection, others
not arrived at their full growth; both however are promiscuously
gathered, and are afterwards sorted into different classes, according
to their age, size, and quality; the youngest particularly
are carefully separated, and are often sold for the first gathering
or Imperial Tea. The tea collected at this time is
called Tootsjaa, or Chinese Tea, because it is infused, and
drank after the Chinese manner (<span class="smcap">Sect. IX. I.</span>) It is divided
by the Tea-dealers and merchants into four kinds, distinguished
by as many names.</p>

<p>III. The third and last gathering is made in the third Japanese
month, which falls about our June, when the leaves are
very plentiful and full grown. This kind of Tea, called Ban
Tsjaa, is the coarsest, and is chiefly drank by the lower class of
people (<span class="smcap">Sect. IX. III.</span>)</p>

<p>Some confine themselves to two gatherings in the year, their
first and second answering the preceding second and third.
Others have only one general gathering<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, which they make
also at the same time with the preceding third or last gathering:
however, the leaves collected at each time, are respectively
separated into different sortments.</p>

<p>The Chinese collect the Tea at certain seasons<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, but whether
the same as in Japan, we are not so well informed, most probably,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
however, the Tea harvest is nearly at the same periods,
as the natives have frequent intercourse, and their commercial
concerns with each other are very extensive<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">METHOD OF CURING OR PREPARING TEA
IN JAPAN.</span></h3>


<p>Public buildings, or drying houses, are erected for curing
Tea, and so regulated, that every person, who either has not
suitable conveniences, or wants the requisite skill, may bring
his leaves at any time to be dried. These buildings contain
from five to ten or twenty small furnaces, about three feet
high, each having at the top a large flat iron pan<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, either high,
square, or round, bent up a little on that side which is over
the mouth of the furnace, which at once secures the operator
from the heat of the furnace, and prevents the leaves from
falling off.</p>

<p>There is also a long low table covered with matts, on which
the leaves are laid, and rolled by workmen, who sit round it.
The iron pan being heated to a certain degree by a little fire
made in the furnace underneath, a few pounds of the fresh-gathered
leaves are put upon the pan; the fresh and juicy leaves
crack when they touch the pan, and it is the business of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
operator to shift them as quick as possible with his bare hands,
till they grow too hot to be easily endured. At this instant he
takes off the leaves, with a kind of shovel resembling a fan,
and pours them on the matts to the rollers, who, taking small
quantities at a time, roll them in the palms of their hands in
one direction, while others are fanning them, that they may
cool the more speedily, and retain their curl the longer<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>This process is repeated two or three times, or oftener, before
the Tea is put in the stores, in order that all the moisture
of the leaves may be thoroughly dissipated, and their curl more
completely preserved. On every repetition the pan is less
heated, and the operation performed more slowly and cautiously<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
The Tea is then separated into the different kinds,
and deposited in the store for domestic use or exportation.</p>

<p>As the leaves of the Ficki Tea (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> VI. and IX. <span class="allsmcap">II.</span>), are
usually reduced into a powder before they are drank, they
should be roasted to a greater degree of dryness. As some of
these are gathered when very young, tender, and small, they
are first immersed in hot water, taken out immediately, and
dried without being rolled at all.</p>

<p>Country people cure their leaves in earthen kettles<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, which
answer every necessary purpose at less trouble and expence,
whereby they are enabled to sell them cheaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>To complete the preparation, after the Tea has been kept
for some months, it must be taken out of the vessels, in which
it had been contained, and dried again over a very gentle fire,
that it may be deprived of any humidity which remained, or
might since have been contracted.</p>

<p>The common Tea is kept in <ins class="corr" id="tn-35" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'earthern pots'">
earthen pots</ins> with narrow
mouths; but the best sort of Tea used by the Emperor and
nobility is put in porcellane or China vessels. The Bantsjaa,
or coarsest Tea, is kept by the country people in straw baskets,
made in the shape of barrels, which they place under the roofs
of their houses, near the hole that lets out the smoke, and
imagine that this situation does not injure the Tea.</p>

<p>This is the relation we have from Kæmpfer of the method
in which the Japanese collected and cured their Tea. In the
accounts of China, authors have in general treated very slightly
of the cultivation and preparation of Tea. Le Compte<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> indeed
observes, that to have good Tea, the leaves should be gathered
while they are small, tender, and juicy. They begin commonly
to gather them in the months of March and April, according
as the season is forward; they afterwards expose them
to the steam of boiling water to soften them; and, as soon as
they are penetrated by it, they draw them over copper plates<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
kept on the fire, which dries them by degrees, till they grow
brown, and roll up of themselves in that manner we see them.</p>

<p>However, it is certain, from the Chinese drawings, which
exhibit a faithful picture, though rudely executed, of the
whole process from beginning to end, that the Tea tree grows
for the most part in hilly countries, on their rocky summits,
and steep declivities; and it would seem by the pains the
Chinese are at, in making paths, and fixing a kind of scaffolds,
to assist them, that these places afford the finest Tea.
It appears from these drawings, that the trees in general are
not much taller than man’s height: The gatherers of the
leaves are never represented but on the ground; they make
use of hooked sticks indeed, but these seem rather intended
to draw the branches towards them, when they hang over
brooks, rivers, or from places difficult of access, than to
bend down the tops or upper branches of the trees on plain
ground.</p>

<p>They pick the leaves as soon as gathered into different sorts,
and cure them nearly in the manner described to be practised
by the Japanese. They build a range of stoves, like those in
a chemist’s laboratory, or great kitchen, where the men work,
and curl the leaves in the pans themselves. It seems also that
they repeat the drying. They dry it likewise, after having
spread it abroad in shallow baskets, in the sun; and, by the
means of sieves, separate the larger from the smaller leaves, and
these again from the dust.</p>

<p>The Chinese put the finer kinds of Tea into conic vessels,
like sugar loaves, made of tutenaque, tin, or lead, covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
with neat matting of bamboo; or in square wooden boxes lined
with thin lead, dry leaves and paper, in which manner it is exported
to foreign countries. The common Tea is put into
baskets, out of which it is emptied, and packed up in boxes or
chests as soon as it is sold to the Europeans<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>One thing should be mentioned to their credit; when their
harvest of Tea is finished, each family fails not to testify, by
some religious rite, their gratitude to the Giver.</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">VARIETIES OF TEA.</span></h3>


<p>It has been already observed (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> VI.) that many
different sortments of Tea are made during the times of collecting
the leaves; and these are multiplied according to the
goodness of their preparation, by which the varieties of Tea
may be considerably augmented<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. The distinctions with us are
much more limited, being generally confined to three principal
kinds of green, and five of bohea.</p>


<h4>I. Those of the former are,</h4>

<p><span class="allsmcap">I.</span> Bing, imperial, or bloom Tea, with a large loose leaf, of
a light green colour, and faint delicate smell.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">II.</span> Hy-tiann, hi-kiong, or hayssuen, known to us by the
name of Hyson Tea, so called after an East-India merchant of
that name, who first imported it into Europe. The leaves are
closely curled and small, of a green colour, verging towards
blue<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">III.</span> Singlo, or songlo, which name it receives, like many
other Teas, from the place where it is cultivated.</p>


<h4>II. The bohea Teas.</h4>

<p><span class="allsmcap">I.</span> Soochuen, or sutchong, by the Chinese called saatyang,
and sact-chaon, or su-tyann, is a superior kind of long-fou Tea.
It imparts a yellowish green colour, by infusion<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">II.</span> Camho, or soumlo, called after the name of the place
where it is gathered; a fragrant Tea with a violet smell. Its
infusion is pale.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">III.</span> Cong-fou, congo, or bong-fo. This has a larger leaf
than the following, and the infusion is a little deeper coloured.
It resembles the common bohea in the colour of the leaf<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> Pekao, pecko, or pekoe, by the Chinese called back-ho,
or pack-ho. It is known by having the appearance of small
white flowers intermixed with it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">V.</span> Common bohea, called moji by the Chinese, consists of
leaves of one colour<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>


<p class="p1 negin1">III. There has also been imported a sort of Tea, in balls, of a
different form from any of the preceding, made up into
cakes or balls of different sizes, by the Chinese called Poncultcha.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">I.</span> The largest kind of this cake Tea, that I have seen, weighs
about two ounces; the infusion and taste resemble those of good
bohea Tea.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">II.</span> Another sort, which is a kind of green Tea, is called
tio tè: it is rolled up in a round shape, about the size of peas,
and sometimes as large as a nutmeg.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">III.</span> The smallest kind done in this form is called gun-powder
Tea.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> Sometimes the succulent Tea leaves are twisted into
cords like packthread, about an inch and a half or two inches
long; and usually three of these are tied together at the ends
by different-coloured silk threads. These resemble little bavins,
one of which might suffice for tea for one person. I have seen
them both of green and bohea Tea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Chinese likewise prepare an extract from Tea, which
they exhibit as a medicine dissolved in a large quantity of water,
and ascribe to it many powerful effects in fevers and other

extract is sometimes formed into small cakes, not much broader

<p>That there is only one species of Tea tree, has already been
mentioned (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> I.) from which all the varieties of Tea are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
procured. Kæmpfer, who is of this opinion, attributes the
difference of Teas to the soil and culture of the plant, age of
the leaves when gathered, and method of curing them<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.
These circumstances will severally have more or less influence;
though whether they account for all the varieties observable in
Tea may be doubted. The bohea Tea trees, now introduced
into many botanic gardens near London, exhibit very obvious
varieties. The leaves are of a deeper green colour, and not
so deeply serrated; the stalk is usually of a darker colour, and
the whole shrub appears less luxuriant <ins class="corr" id="err-41" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'than that'">
as</ins> represented in the annexed plate of the bohea Tea; but the botanical characters
are the same.</p>

  <div class="caption">Bohea Tea.</div>
</div>

<p>I infused all the sorts of green and bohea Teas I could procure,
and expanded the different leaves on paper, to compare
their respective size and texture, intending thereby to discover
their age. I found the leaves of green Tea as large as those
of bohea, and nearly as fibrous; which would lead one to
suspect, that the difference does not so much depend upon
the age, as upon the other circumstances.</p>

<p>We know that in Europe the soil, culture, and exposure,
have great influence on all kinds of vegetables: but the same
species of plants differ in the same province, and even in the
same district; and in Japan, and particularly along the continent
of China, it must be much more considerable, where the air is
in some parts very cold, in others moderate, or warm almost to
an extreme. I am persuaded that the method of preparation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
must also have no little influence. I have dried the leaves of
some European plants in the manner described (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> VI.)
which so much resembled the foreign Tea, that the infusion
made from them has been seen and drunk without suspicion.
In these preparations which I made, some of the leaves retained
a perfect curl, and a fine verdure like the best green
Tea; and others cured at the same time were more like the
bohea<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p>I would not, however, lay too much stress upon the result
of a few trials, nor endeavour to preclude further enquiries
about a subject which at some future period may prove of
more immediate concern to this nation.</p>

<p>We might still try to discover whether other arts, than are yet
known here, are not used with Tea before its exportation from
China, to produce the difference of colour<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, and flavour<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>,
peculiar to different sorts. An intelligent friend of mine informs
me, that in a set of Chinese drawings, in his possession, representing
the whole process of manufacturing Tea, there are in one
sheet the figures of several persons apparently separating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
different kinds of Tea, and drying it in the sun, with several
baskets landing near them filled with a very white substance,
and in considerable quantity. To what use this may be applied
is uncertain, as well as what the substance is; yet there is no
doubt, he thinks, that it is used in the manufacturing of Tea,
as the Chinese seldom bring any thing into their pieces but such
as relate in some respect to the business before them.</p>

<p class="p1">Sir George Staunton, in his Embassy to China, Vol. II.
p. 467, describes another Plant, whose flowers are used for the
purpose of scenting Tea. The flower resembles the dog-rose,
and the leaves those of Tea; hence the Chinese call it Cha-whaw,
or flower of Tea. A Plate of this Plant is annexed,
with the following description, which this very accurate and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
learned traveller has obligingly permitted me to introduce
here.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp62" id="i046" style="max-width: 46.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i046.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><em>Camellia Sesanqua.</em></div>
</div>

<p>“A Plant very like the Tea flourished at this time on the tides
and the very tops of mountains, where the soil consisted of
little more than fragments of stone crumbled into a sort of
coarse earth by the joint action of the sun and rain. The
Chinese call this plant Cha-whaw, or Flower of Tea, on account
of the resemblance of one to the other; and because its
petals, as well as the entire flowers of the Arabian jessamine,
are sometimes mixed among the Teas, in order to increase
their fragrance.</p>

<p>“This plant, the Cha-whaw, is the Camellia Sesanqua of the
botanists, and yields a nut, from whence is expressed an esculent
oil equal to the best which comes from Florence. It is
cultivated on this account in vast abundance; and is particularly
valuable, from the facility of its culture, in situations fit
for little else.” It is delineated on the opposite page.</p>

<p>As green Tea is by some suspected to have been cured on
copper, they have attributed the verdure to be derived from
that metal (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> VII.); but, if there were any foundation
for this supposition, the volatile alkali, mixed with an
infusion of such Tea, would detect the least portion of copper,
by turning the infusion blue<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>Others have, with less propriety, attributed the verdure to
green copperas<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; but this ingredient, which is only salt of iron,
would immediately turn the leaves black, and the infusion made
from the Tea would be of a deep purple colour<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>Is it not more probable, that some green dye, prepared from
vegetable substances, is used for the colouring?</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">DRINKING OF TEA.</span></h3>


<p>Neither the Chinese, nor natives of Japan, ever use Tea
before it has been kept at least a year; because when fresh it is
said to prove narcotic, and to disorder the senses<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. The
former pour hot water on the Tea, and draw off the infusion
in the same manner as is now practised in Europe; but
they drink it simply without the addition of sugar or milk<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
The Japanese reduce the Tea into a fine powder, by grinding
the leaves in a hand-mill; they then mix them with hot water
into a thin pulp, in which form it is sipped<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, particularly by the
nobility and rich people. It is made and served up to company
in the following manner: the Tea-table furniture, with
the powdered Tea inclosed in a box, are set before the company,
and the cups are then filled with hot water, and as much
of the powder as might lie on the point of a moderate-sized
knife is taken out of the box, put into each cup, and then
stirred and mixed together with a curious denticulated instrument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
till the liquor foams, in which state it is presented to the
company, and sipped while warm<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. From what Du Halde
relates, this method is not peculiar to the Japanese, but is also
used in some provinces of China<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>The common people, who have a coarser Tea (<span class="smcap">Sect. VI. III.</span>)
boil it for some time in water, and make use of the liquor for
common drink. Early in the morning the kettle, filled with
water, is regularly hung over the fire for this purpose, and the
Tea is either put into the kettle inclosed in a bag, or, by means
of a basket of a proper size, pressed to the bottom of the vessel,
that there may not be any hindrance in drawing off the water.
The Bantsjaa Tea (<span class="smcap">Sect. VI. III.</span>) only is used in this manner,
whose virtues, being more fixed, would not be so fully extracted
by infusion.</p>

<p>And indeed Tea is the common beverage of all the labouring
people in China: one scarcely ever sees them represented at
work of any kind, but the Tea pot and Tea cup appear as
their accompaniments. Reapers, threshers, and all who work
out of doors, as well as within, have these attendants<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>To make Tea, and to serve it in a genteel and graceful manner,
is an accomplishment, in which people of both sexes in
Japan are instructed by masters, in the same manner as Europeans
are in dancing, and other branches of polite education.</p>

<p>Curiosity and interest would mutually induce the Europeans
to make the most diligent enquiries in order to discover
the real Tea shrub, or a substitute in some other vegetable
most resembling it. Simon Paulli, a celebrated physician and
botanist at Copenhagen, was the first who pretended to have
discovered the real Tea plant in Europe. By opening some
Tea leaves, he found them so much like those of the Dutch
myrtle<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, (Flor. Su. 907.) that he obstinately maintained they
were productions of the same species of Tea; though he was
afterwards refuted by several botanists in Europe, and by the
specimens sent to him, and to Dr. Mentzel of Berlin, from the
East-Indies, by Dr. Cleyer<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>Father Labat next thought he had discovered the real Tea-plant
in Martinico<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, agreeing, he says, in all respects with the
China sort. He pretends also to have procured Tea seeds from
the East Indies, and to have raised the plant in America; but, from
his own account, this supposed Tea appears to be only a species
of Lysimachia, or what is called West-India Tea<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>Many other pretended discoveries of the Oriental Tea-tree
have been related; all which have proved erroneous, when properly
enquired into. The genus of plant, called by Kæmpfer
Tsubakki<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, has the nearest resemblance to it. The leaves of several
European herbs have been used at different times as substitutes
for Tea, either from some similarity in the shape of the leaves,
or in the taste and flavour; among these, two or three species of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Veronica are particularly recommended<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, besides the leaves of
sage<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, myrtle<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, betony<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, sloe<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, agrimony, wild rose<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, and
many others<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. Whether any of these are really more salutary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
or not, is undetermined; and we now find, that from the
palace to the cottage every other substitute has yielded to the
genuine Asiatic Tea<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">PRESERVING THE SEEDS FOR VEGETATION.</span></h3>


<p>Many attempts to introduce the Tea-tree into Europe
have proved unsuccessful, owing to the bad state of the seeds
when first procured, or to a want of judgement in preserving them
long enough in a state capable of vegetation. If this complaint
arise from the first cause, future precautions about such seeds
will be in vain; it is therefore necessary to procure fresh,
sound, ripe seeds, white, plump, and moist internally.</p>

<p>Two methods of preserving the seeds have put us in possession
of a few young plants of the true Tea-tree of China;
one is, by inclosing the seeds in bees wax, after they have been
well dried in the sun; and the other, by putting them, included
in their pods, or capsules, into very close cannisters made
of tin and tutenague<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp65" id="i055" style="max-width: 46.875em;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>But neither of these methods have succeeded generally,
notwithstanding the utmost care, both in getting fresh seeds,
and in securing them in the most effectual manner. The best
method is to sow the ripe seeds in good light earth, in boxes,
at leaving Canton; covering them with wire, to prevent rats
and other such vermin coming to them. The boxes, plans of
which are annexed, should not be exposed to too much air, nor
to the spray of the sea, if possible. The earth should not be
suffered to grow dry and hard, but a little fresh or rain water
may be sprinkled over it now and then; and, when the seedling
plants appear, they should be kept moist, and out of the burning
sun<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Most of the plants now in England were procured by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
these means; and though many of the seedlings will die, yet by
this kind of management we may probably succeed in bringing
over the most curious vegetable productions of China, of which
they have an amazing treasure, both in respect to use, shew, and
variety<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. If young plants could be procured in China, they
might be sent over in a growing state in some of these boxes.</p>

<p>The young Tea-plants in the gardens about London thrive
very well in the green-houses in winter, and some bear the
open air in summer. The leaves of many of them are from
one to three inches long, not without a fine deep verdure;
and the young shoots are succulent. It is therefore probable,
that in a few years many layers may be procured from them,
and the number of plants considerably increased thereby.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to observe here, that many exotic
vegetables, like human constitutions, require a certain period
before they become naturalized to a change of climate; many
plants, which on their first introduction would not bear our
winters without shelter, now endure our hardest frosts; the
beautiful magnolia, among several others, is a proof of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
observation; and we have already taken notice (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> V.),
that the degree of cold at Pekin sometimes exceeds ours.
We have hence reason to expect, that the Tea-tree may in a
few years be capable of bearing our climate, or at least that of
our colonies; at length thrive, as if indigenous to the soil;
and, were labour cheaper, become an article of export<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, like
the common potatoe, for which we are indebted to America,
or Spain<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. It is, however, better suited for the climates of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
the Southern parts of Europe, and America; but hitherto
it has not been cultivated in an extensive manner, in either of
these quarters of the world; nor is it likely ever to be, whilst it
can be procured from Asia at the present reduced price. It
was introduced into Georgia about the year 1770. Hence the
ingenious author of Ouabi (Mrs. Morton) in her recent poem of
Beave-hill, in describing the products of this province, introduces
the exotic of China:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Yet round these shores prolific plenty twines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stores the thick field, and swells the cluttering vines;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A thousand groves their glossy leaves unfold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the rich orange rolls its ruddy gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>China’s green shrub</em>, divine Magnolia’s bloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With mingling odours fling their high perfume.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is indeed probable that the North American summers, in
the same latitude with Pekin, would suit this Tree better than
ours; for, in China and some parts of North America, the
heat in summer is such, that vegetables make quicker and more
early shoots, whereby they have time to acquire sufficient
strength and firmness before the winter commences: but, in
England, the tender shoots are puttied forth late, and, winter soon
after succeeding, they often perish, in a degree of cold much
less severe than at Pekin, or in colder latitudes of North
America.</p>

<p class="p1">As the custom of drinking Tea is become general,
every person may be considered as a judge of its effects, at
least so far as it concerns his own health; but, as the constitutions
of mankind are various, the effects of this infusion must
be different also, which is the reason that so many opinions
have prevailed upon the subject.</p>

<p>Many, who have once conceived a prejudice against it, suffer
it to influence their judgement too far, and condemn the custom
as universally pernicious. Others, who are no less biassed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
on the other extreme, would make their own private experience
a standard for that of all, and ascribe the most extensive virtues
to this infusion. This contrariety of opinion has been particularly
maintained among physicians<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>; which will ever be the case,
while mere suppositions are placed in the room of experiments
and facts impartially related.</p>

<p>Some physicians, however, avoid both extremes; who,
without commending it, or decrying it universally, admit its
use, while they are not insensible of the injuries it may produce.
It requires no small share of sagacity to fix the limits
of good and harm in the present case: multitudes of all ages,
constitutions, and complexions, drink it freely, during a long
life, without perceiving any ill effects. Others, again, soon
experience many inconveniences from drinking any considerable
quantity of this infusion.</p>

<p>It is difficult to draw certain conclusions from experiments
made on this herb. The parts which seem to produce these
opposite effects are very fugitive. We become acquainted
chiefly with the grosser parts by analysis. I made the following
experiments with considerable care; but, I own, they inform us
not sufficiently wherein consists that grateful relaxing sedative
property, which proves to the generality of mankind so refreshing;
nor from whence it is, that others feel from the pleasing
beverage so many disagreeable effects. Accurate observation
would instruct us in this difficult investigation, more than simple
experiments on the subject itself.</p>

<h4 class="fs120"><span class="gesperrt">EXPERIMENT</span>&nbsp; I.</h4>

<p>I took an equal quantity of an infusion of superfine green
Tea, and of common bohea Tea, made equally strong; and
also the same quantity of the liquor remaining after distillation
(<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> III. <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>), and of simple water; into each of which, contained
in separate vessels, I put two drachms of beef, that had
been killed about two days.</p>

<p>The beef, which was immersed in the simple water, became
putrid in forty-eight hours; but the pieces in the two infusions
of Tea, and in the liquor remaining after distillation, shewed
no signs of putrefaction, till after about seventy hours<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="fs120"><span class="gesperrt">EXPERIMENT</span>&nbsp; II.</h4>

<p>Into strong infusions of every kind of green and bohea Tea
that I could procure, I put equal quantities of salt of iron
(sal martis), which immediately changed the several infusions
into a deep purple colour<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>It is evident from these experiments, that both green and
bohea Tea possess an antiseptic (<span class="smcap">Experiment</span> I.), and astringent
power (<span class="smcap">Experiment</span> II.), applied to the dead animal
fibre.</p>

<p class="p1">Nevertheless, as I have often observed that drinking
Tea, particularly the most highly-flavoured fine green, proves
remarkably relaxing to many persons of tender and delicate
constitutions, I was induced to prosecute my enquiries farther.</p>

<p>1. To this end I distilled half a pound of the best and
most fragrant green Tea with simple water<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, and drew off an
ounce of very odorous and pellucid water, free from oil, and
which on trial (<span class="smcap">Section</span> I. <span class="smcap">Experiment</span> II.) shewed no signs
of astringency.</p>

<p>2. That part of the liquor which remained after distillation,
was evaporated to the consistence of an extract; it was slightly
odorous, but had a very bitter, styptic, or astringent taste.
The quantity of the extract thus procured weighed about five
ounces and a half<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="r40a" />
<hr class="r40bb" />

<h4 class="fs120"><span class="gesperrt">EXPERIMENT</span>&nbsp; III.</h4>

<p class="negin1">a. Into the cavity of the abdomen, and cellular membrane of a
frog, about three drachms of the distilled odorous water
(No. 1.) were injected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>In twenty minutes, one hind leg of the frog appeared
much affected, and a general loss of motion and sensibility
succeeded<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. The affection of the limb continued for four
hours, and the universal torpidity remained above nine hours;
after this the animal gradually recovered its former vigor.</p>

<p class="negin1">b. In like manner some of the liquor remaining after the distillation
of the green Tea (No. 1.) was injected; but this was
not productive of any sensible effect.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="r40a" />
<hr class="r40bb" />

<h4 class="fs120"><span class="gesperrt">EXPERIMENT</span>&nbsp; IV.</h4>


<p class="negin1">a. To the ischatic nerves laid bare, and to the cavity of the
abdomen of a frog, I applied some of the distilled odorous
water (No. 1. and <span class="smcap">Experiment</span> III, 1.). In the space of
half an hour, the hindermost extremities became altogether
paralytic and insensible; and in about an hour afterwards the
frog died.</p>

<p class="negin1">b. In like manner I applied the liquor remaining after distillation
(No. 1. and <span class="smcap">Experiment</span> III. 2.) to another frog; but no
sedative or paralytic effect was observable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>3. From these experiments the sedative and relaxing effects
of Tea appear greatly to depend upon an odorous fragrant
principle, which abounds most in green Tea, particularly that
which is most highly flavoured<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. This seems farther confirmed
by the practice of the Chinese, who avoid using this plant, till
it has been kept at least twelve months, as they find when
recent it possesses a soporiferous and intoxicating quality.

<p class="p1">Waving, however, any attempts to fix with precision
the effects of Tea from these experiments alone, let us endeavour
to collect from observation likewise, such facts as may
enable us to judge what its effects are on the human frame,
and from thence draw the clearest inferences we can, how far
it is salutary or otherwise.</p>

<p>The long and constant use of Tea, as a part of our diet,
makes us forget to enquire whether it is possessed of any medicinal
properties. We shall endeavour to consider it in both
respects.</p>

<p>The generality of healthy persons find themselves not apparently
affected by the use of Tea: it seems to them a grateful
refreshment, both fitting them for labour and refreshing them
after it. There are instances of persons who have drank it
from their infancy, to old age; have led, at the same time,
active, if not laborious lives; and yet never felt any ill effects
from the constant use of it.</p>

<p>Where this has been the case, the subjects of both sexes
were for the most part healthy, strong, active, and temperate.
Amongst the less hardy and robust, we find complaints, which
are ascribed to Tea, by the parties themselves. Some complain
that after a Tea breakfast, they find themselves rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
fluttered; their hands less steady in writing, or any other employment
that requires an exact command of spirits. This probably
soon goes off, and they feel no other injury from it.
Others again bear it well in the morning, but from drinking it
in the afternoon, find themselves very easily agitated, and
affected with a kind of involuntary trembling.</p>

<p>There are many people who cannot bear to drink a single
dish of Tea, without being immediately sick and disordered at
the stomach: To some it gives excruciating pain about that
part, attended with general tremours. But in general the most
tender and delicate constitutions are most affected by the free
use of Tea; being frequently attacked with pains in the stomach
and bowels; spasmodic affections; attended with a copious
discharge of limpid urine, and great agitation of spirits on the
least noise, hurry, or disturbance.</p>

</h3>

<p class="p1">There is one circumstance, however, that renders it
more difficult to investigate the certain effects of Tea; which
is, the great unwillingness that most people shew, to giving us
a genuine account of their uneasy sensations after the free use
of it; from a consciousness that it would be extremely imprudent
to continue its use, after they are convinced from experience
that it is injurious.</p>

<p>That it produces watchfulness in some constitutions is most
certain, when drank at evening in considerable quantities.
Whether warm water, or any other aqueous liquor, would
have the same effect, is not certain.</p>

<p>That it enlivens, refreshes, exhilarates, is likewise well
known. From all which circumstances it would seem, that
Tea contains an active penetrating principle, speedily exciting
the action of the nerves; in very irritable constitutions, to
such a degree as to give very uneasy sensations, and bring on
spasmodic affections: in less irritable constitutions, it rather
gives pleasure, and immediate satisfaction, though not without
occasionally producing some tendency to disagreeable tremours
and agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>The finer the Tea, the more obvious are these effects. It
is perhaps for this, amongst other reasons, that the lower
classes of people, who can only procure the most common, are
in general the least sufferers. I say, in general, because even
amongst them there are many who actually suffer much by
it: they drink it as long as it yields any taste, and, to add to
its flavour, for the most part hot; and thus the quantity which
they take, and the degree of heat in which it is drank, conspire
to produce in them, what the finer kinds of Tea effect in their
superiors.</p>

<p>It ought not, however, to pass unobserved, that in a multitude
of cases the infusions of our own herbs, sage for instance,
mint, baum, even rosemary, and valerian itself, will
sometimes produce similar effects, and leave that sensation of
emptiness, agitation of spirits, flatulence, spasmodic pains, and
other symptoms, that are met with in people, the most of all
others devoted to Tea.</p>

<p>Besides the injuries which the stomach sustains, by taking
the infusion of Tea extremely hot; it is not improbable but
the teeth also are affected by it. Professor Kalm, in his
Travels into North America, observes, that such of the inhabitants
as took their Tea and food in general, in this state,
were frequently liable to lose half their teeth at the age of
twenty, without any hopes of getting new ones. This cannot
be attributed to the variations of weather in that clime, because
the Indians who enjoy the same air, but take their viands
almost cold, were to a great age possessed of fine white teeth;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
as were likewise the Europeans who first settled in America,
before the use of Tea became general. It was no less remarkable,
that the Indian women, who had accustomed themselves
to drink this infusion after the European fashion, had
likewise lost their teeth prematurely, though they had formerly
been quite sound<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. Kalm does not appear to suspect
any injury to the teeth from the sugar used with the
Tea.</p>

<p class="p1">Many, from a supposition that Tea was dried in India
on copper, have attributed its pernicious properties to this
metal; but we have already observed (Part I. § <span class="allsmcap">VIII.</span>), that, if
Tea were tinctured with the least quantity of copper, it might
easily be detected by chemical experiments.</p>

<p>Some have attributed the injurious qualities of this fashionable
exotic upon the stomach to the sugar usually drank with the
Tea; but I have had sufficient opportunities of observing in
the West Indies the good effects of drinking freely the juice of
the sugar-cane, to obviate this objection. I have known feeble
emaciated children, afflicted with worms, tumefied abdomen,
and a variety of diseases, soon emerge from their complicated
ailments, by drinking large draughts of this sweet liquor, and
become healthy and strong<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p>That there is something in the finer green Teas, that produces
effects peculiar to itself, and not to be equalled by any
other substance we know, is, I believe, admitted by all who
have observed, either what passes in themselves, or the accounts
that others give of their feelings, after a plentiful use of this
liquor. Nor are the finer kinds of bohea Teas incapable of the
like influence. They affect the nerves, produce tremblings,
and such a state of body for the time, as subjects it to be agitated
by the most trifling causes, such as shutting a door too
hastily, the sudden entrance even of a servant, and other the
like causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>I know people of both sexes, who are constantly seized with
great uneasiness, anxiety, and oppression, as often as they take
a single cup of Tea, who nevertheless, for the sake of company,
drink several cups of warm water, mixed with sugar and milk,
without the same inconvenience.</p>

<p>A physician, whose acquaintance I have long been favoured
with, and who, with some others, was present when the preceding
experiments were made at the college of Edinburgh,
has a remarkable delicacy in feeling the effects of a small quantity
of fine Tea. If drank in the forenoon, it affects his stomach
with an uneasy sensation, which continues for several hours,
and entirely takes away his appetite for food at dinner; though
at other times, when he takes chocolate for breakfast, he generally
makes a very hearty meal at noon, and enjoys the most
perfect health. If he drink a single dish of tea in the afternoon,
it affects him in the same manner, and deprives him of sleep
for three or four hours through the succeeding night; yet he
can take a cup of warm water with sugar and milk, without the
least inconvenience.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that opium has nearly the same effect
upon him as Tea, but in a greater degree; for he informs me,
that when he once accidentally took a quantity of the solution
of opium, it had not the least tendency to induce sleep, but
produced a very disagreeable uneasiness at his stomach, approaching
to nausea. The late celebrated Professor Whytt<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, of
Edinburgh, affords a striking example how injurious the effects
of Tea may be upon constitutions, which I shall relate in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
own words. “I once imagined Tea to be in a great measure
unjustly accused; and that it did not hurt the stomach more
than an equal quantity of warm water; but experience has
since taught me the contrary. Strong Tea drunk in any considerable
quantity, in a morning, especially if I eat little bread
with it, generally makes me fainter before dinner than if I had
taken no breakfast at all; at the same time it quickens my pulse,
and often affects me with a kind of giddiness. These bad effects
of Tea are most remarkable when my stomach is out of
order.”</p>

<p class="p1">I am informed likewise by a physician, of long and extensive
practice in the city, that he has known several instances
of a spitting of blood having been brought on, by breathing in
an air loaded with the fine dust of Tea. It is customary for
those who deal largely in this article to mix different kinds together,
so as to suit the different palates of their customers.
This is generally performed in the back part of their shops,
several chests perhaps being mixed together at the same
time. Those who are much employed in this work are at
length very often sufferers by it; some are seized with sudden
bleedings from the lungs or from the nostrils; and others attacked
with violent coughs, ending in consumptions.</p>

<p>These circumstances are chiefly brought in sight to prove,
that, besides a sedative relaxing power, there exists in Tea an
active penetrating substance, which, in many constitutions, cannot
fail of being productive of singular effects.</p>

<p>An eminent Tea-broker, after having examined in one day
upwards of one hundred chests of Tea, only by smelling at
them forcibly, in order to distinguish their respective qualities,
was the next seized with a violent giddiness, <ins class="corr" id="tn-75" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'head ach '">
head ache</ins>, universal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
spasms, and loss of speech and memory. By proper assistance,
the symptoms abated, but he did not totally recover. For,
though his speech returned, and his memory in some degree,
yet he continued, with unequal steps, gradually losing strength,
till a partial paralysis ensued, then a more general one, and at
length he died. Whether this was owing to the effluvia of
the Tea, may perhaps be doubted. Future accidents may possibly
confirm <em>the suspicions</em> to be just or otherwise.</p>

<p class="p1">An assistant to a Tea broker, had frequently for some
weeks complained of pain and giddiness of his head, after examining
and mixing different kinds of Tea: the giddiness was
sometimes so considerable, as to render it necessary for a person
to attend him, in order to prevent any injury he might suffer
from falling or other accident. He was bled in the arm freely,
but without permanent relief; his complaint returned as soon
as he was exposed to his usual employment. At length he was
advised to be electrified, and the shocks were directed to his
head. The next day his pain was diminished, but the day after
closed the tragical scene. I saw him a few hours before he
died; he was insensible; the use of his limbs almost lost, and
he sunk very suddenly into a fatal apoplexy. Whether the
effluvia of the Tea, or electricity, was the cause of this event, is
doubtful. In either view the case is worthy of attention<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>A young man of a delicate constitution, had tried many powerful
medicines in vain, for a depression of spirits, which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
laboured under to a degree of melancholy, which rendered his
situation dangerous to himself and those about him. I found
he drank Tea very plentifully, and therefore requested him to
substitute another kind of diet; which he complied with, and
afterwards gradually recovered his usual health. Some weeks
after this, having a large present of fine green Tea sent him,
he drank a considerable quantity of the infusion on that and
the following day. This was succeeded by his former dejection
and melancholy, with loss of memory, tremblings, a proneness
to great agitation from the most trifling circumstances, and a
numerous train of nervous ailments. I saw him again, and he
immediately attributed his complaints to the Tea he had drank;
since which he has carefully denied himself the same indulgence,
and now enjoys his former health.</p>

<p>I have known many other instances, where less degrees of
depression, and other complaints depending upon a relaxed irritable
habit, have attended delicate people for many years; and
though they have had the advice of skilful physicians, yet in
vain have medicines been administered, till the patient has refrained
from the infusion of this fragrant exotic<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">In treating of this substance, I would not be understood
to be either a partial advocate, or a passionate accuser. I have
often regretted that Tea should possess any pernicious qualities,
as the pleasure which arises from reflecting how many millions
of our fellow-creatures are enjoying at one hour the same
amusing repast; the occasions it furnishes for agreeable conversation;
the innocent parties of both sexes it daily draws together,
and entertains without the aid of spirituous liquors;
would afford grateful sensations to a social breast. But justice
demands something more. It stands charged by many able
writers, by public opinion, partly derived from experience,
with being the cause of many disorders; all that train of
distempers included under the name of <span class="allsmcap">NERVOUS</span> are said to
be, if not the offspring, at least highly aggravated by the
use of Tea. To enumerate all these would be to transcribe
volumes. It is not impossible but the charges may be partly
true. Let us examine them with all possible candour.</p>

<p>The effect of drinking large quantities of any warm aqueous
liquor, according to all the experiments we are acquainted with,
would be, to enter speedily into the course of circulation, and
pass off as speedily by urine or perspiration, or the increase of
some of the secretions. Its effects on the solid parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
constitution would be relaxing, and thereby enfeebling. If this
warm aqueous fluid were taken in considerable quantities, its
effects would be proportionable; and still greater, if it were substituted
instead of nutriment<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p>That all infusions of herbs may be considered in this light
seems not unreasonable. The infusion of Tea, nevertheless,
has these two particularities. It is not only possessed of a
sedative quality (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. <span class="smcap">Exp.</span> III. IV.), but also of a considerable
astringency (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. <span class="smcap">Exp.</span> II.); by which the relaxing
power ascribed to a mere aqueous fluid is in some measure
corrected. It is, on account of the latter, perhaps less injurious
than many other infusions of herbs, which, besides a very slight
aromatic flavour, have very little if any stypticity, to prevent
their relaxing debilitating effects.</p>

<p>Tea, therefore, if not too fine, nor drank too hot, or in too
great quantities, is, perhaps, preferable to any other vegetable
infusion we know. And if we take into consideration likewise
its known enlivening energy, it will appear that our attachment
to Tea is not merely from its being costly or fashionable,
but from its superiority in taste and effects to most other
vegetables.</p>

<p class="p1">It may be of some use in our inquiries to consider its
effects where it has been long and universally used. Of Japan
we know little at present: of China we have more recent
accounts; from these it appears, that Tea of some kind, coarser
or finer, is drank plentifully by all degrees of people; the
general provision of the lower ranks especially is rice, their
beverage Tea. The superior classes of people drink Tea; but
they likewise partake of animal food, and live freely.</p>

<p>Of their diseases we know but little, nor what effects Tea
may have in this respect. They seldom or never bleed. The
late Dr. Arnot, of Canton, a gentleman who did his profession
and his country honour, and was in the highest estimation with
the Chinese, I am informed, was the first person who could
ever prevail upon any of the Chinese to be blooded<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, be their
maladies what they might. It would appear from hence, that
inflammatory diseases were not frequent among them; otherwise
a nation, who seem so fond of life as the Chinese are reputed
to be, would by some means or other have admitted of
this almost only remedy in such cases. May we infer from
hence, that inflammatory diseases are less frequent in China,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
than in some other countries, and that one cause of this may be
the constant and liberal use of this infusion? Perhaps, if we take
a view of the slate of diseases, as exactly described a century
ago, and compare it with what we may observe at present, we
may have a collateral support for this suggestion. If we consider
the frequency of inflammatory diseases in Sydenham’s time, who
was both a consummate judge of these diseases, and described
them faithfully, I believe we shall find they were then much
more frequent than they are present; at least, if any deference
is due to the observations of judicious persons, who mostly
agree, that genuine inflammatory diseases are much more rare
at present, than they were at the time when Sydenham wrote.
It is true, this disposition, admitting it be fact, may arise from
various causes; amongst the rest, it is not improbable, Tea may
have its share.</p>

<p class="p1">Before the use of Tea, the general breakfast in this
country consisted of more substantial aliment<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>; milk in various
shapes, ale and beer, with toast, cold meat, and other additions.
The like additions, with sack, and the most generous wines,
found their way amongst the higher orders of mankind. And
one cannot suppose but that such a diet, and the usual exercise
they took, would produce a very different state of blood and
other animal juices, from that which Tea, a little milk or
cream, and bread and butter, affords.</p>

<p>It was not the breakfast only that seems to have contributed
its share towards introducing a material alteration in the animal
system, but the subsequent regale likewise in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
Tea is a second time brought before company; it is drank by
most people, and often in no very small quantities. Before the
introduction of this exotic, it was not unusual to entertain afternoon
guests in a very different manner; jellies, tarts, sweet-meats;
nay, cold meat, wine, cyder, strong ale, and even spirituous
liquors under the title of cordials, were often brought
out on these occasions, and perhaps taken to excess, much to
the injury of individuals.</p>

<p>This kind of repast would tend to keep up the natural inflammatory
diathesis, which was the result of vigour, and a plenitude
of rich blood, as well as savour diseases originating from
such causes. It seems not unreasonable therefore to suppose,
that, as the diet of our ancestors was more generous, their exercises
more athletic, and their diseases more generally the produce
of a rich blood, than are observable in the present times,
these debilitating effects before-mentioned may in part be
attributed to the use of Tea, as no cause appears to be so general
and so probable.</p>

<p class="p1">If these suggestions are admitted, they will assist us in
determining when and to whom the use of Tea is salutary, and
to whom it may be deemed injurious. Those, for instance,
who either from a natural propensity to generate a rich inflammatory
blood, or from exercise, or diet, or climate, or all together,
are disposed to be in this situation: to these the use of
Tea would seem rather beneficial, by relaxing the too rigid
solids, and diluting the coagulable lymph of the blood, as a very
sensible and ingenious author very justly styles it<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>There are idiosyncrases, certain particularities, which are
objections to general rules. There are, for instance, men of
this temperament, strong, healthy, vigorous, and with not only
the appearance, but the requisites of firm health, to whom a
few dishes of Tea would produce the agitations familiar to an
hysteric woman; but this is by no means general: in common
they bear it well, it requisites them, they endure fatigue after
it, as well as after the most substantial viands. Nothing refreshes
them more than Tea, after lasting and vehement exercise.
To such it is undoubtedly wholesome, and equal at least,
if not preferable, to any other kind of regale now in use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>But, if we consider what may reasonably be supposed to happen
to those who are in the opposite extreme of health and
vigour; that is, the tender, delicate, enfeebled, whose solids are
debilitated, their blood thin and aqueous, the appetite lost or
depraved, without exercise, or exercising improperly; in short,
where the disposition of the whole frame is altogether opposite
to the inflammatory; the free and unrestrained use of this infusion,
and such accompanyments, must unavoidably contribute
to sink the remains of vital strength still lower.</p>

<p>Between these two extremes there are many gradations; and,
every thing else being alike, Tea will in general be found more
or less beneficial or injurious to individuals, in proportion as their
constitutions approach nearer to these opposite extremes. To
descend into all the particulars would require experience and
abilities, more than I can boast. Suffice it to say, that, except
as a medicine, or after great fatigue, large quantities are seldom
beneficial, nor should it ever be drank very hot; and, as hath
been already mentioned, the finer Tea, the green especially, is
more to be suspected than the common or middling kinds.</p>

<p class="p1">The experiments and observations hitherto related render
it evident, that Tea possesses a fragrant volatile principle, which
in general tends to relax and enfeeble the system of delicate
persons, particularly when it is drank hot, and in large quantities.
I have known many of this frame of constitution, who
have been persuaded, on account of their health, to deny themselves
this fashionable infusion, and received great benefit
(<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> VII.). Others, who have found their health impaired
by this indulgence, are unhappily induced to continue it for
want of an agreeable substitute, especially for breakfast.</p>

<p>But, if such cannot wholly omit this favourite regale, they
may certainly take it with more safety, by boiling the Tea a
few minutes, in order to dissipate this fragrant principle (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span>
II. 1, and <span class="smcap">Exp.</span> IV.) which is the most noxious; and extract
the bitter, astringent, and most stomachic part (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. 2, and
<span class="smcap">Exp.</span> III.) instead of preparing it in the usual manner by infusion.</p>

<p>An eminent physician in the city, frequently experiencing
the prejudicial effects of Tea by drinking it in the usual form,
was induced, from reading a dissertation upon this subject,
published some time since at Leyden<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, to try the infusion prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
after another manner. He ordered the Tea to be infused
in hot water, which after a few hours he caused to be poured
off, stand over night, and to be made warm again in the morning
for breakfast. By this means, he assures me, he can take,
without inconvenience, near double the quantity of Tea, which
formerly, when prepared in the usual method, produced many
disagreeable nervous complaints.</p>

<p>The same end is obtained by substituting the extract of Tea
(<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. 2.) instead of the leaves. It may be used in the
form of Tea, by dissolving it in warm water; and, as the fragrancy
of the Tea is in this case dissipated, the nervous relaxing
effects, which follow the drinking it in the usual manner, would
be in great measure avoided. This extract has been imported
into Europe from China, in flat round dark-coloured cakes, not
exceeding a quarter of an ounce each in weight, ten grains of
which, dissolved in a sufficient quantity of water, might suffice
one person for breakfast. It might also be made here without
much expence or trouble (See <span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. 2.).</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that in all the forms which Du Halde relates,
for administering Tea as a stomachic medicine among the
Chinese, it is ordered to be boiled for some time, or prepared in
such a manner, as to cause a dissipation of its fragrant perishable
flavour; which practice, as it seems consonant to experiments
here (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. <span class="smcap">Exp.</span> III.), may probably have taken its
rise in China, from long experience and repeated facts.</p>

<p class="p1">Perhaps it will not be deemed foreign to an essay
upon this subject, to take a concise view of the manners
and dispositions of the Chinese, as we have done of their
diseases. Those who are best acquainted with human nature
seem to ascribe even to their food, and way of life, as
well as to their climate and education, certain propensities
at least to vice and virtue; and it may be of use to draw
what light we can in these respects, from the character of a
people, who have used the infusion of Tea for a long series
of years.</p>

<p>They are in general described to be a people of moderate
strength of body, not capable of much hard labour, rather
feeble when compared with the inhabitants of some nations,
excelling in some minute fabricks and manufactures, but exhibiting
no proofs of elevated genius in architecture, either civil
or military. They are said to be pusillanimous, cunning,
extremely libidinous, and remarkable for dissimulation and
selfishness<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, effeminate, revengeful, and dishonest<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>It would be unjust to ascribe all these qualities to their manner
of living: other causes have undoubtedly their share:
but it may be suspected, that the manner of life, or kind of
diet, that tends to debilitate, virtually contributes to the increase
of the meaner qualities. When force of body is wanting,
cunning often supplies its place; and if not regulated
by other principles, it would discover its effects more universally;
and thus will take place whether the debility is natural,
or acquired by a diet that enfeebles the body. That there is a
probity, fortitude, and generosity, in female minds, not inferior
to the like qualities possessed by the other sex, is most certain;
but that it is generally so may perhaps be doubted;</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">For softness she, and sweet attractive grace<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whether the present age exhibits as many instances of superior
excellence as the preceding, is beyond my abilities to
determine: that it is tarnished more than some others with
one vice at least, is generally confessed; and it may, perhaps,
be a problem not unworthy of consideration, whether the
general use of Tea may not gradually increase the disposition.
For whatever tends to debilitate, seems for the most part to
augment corporeal sensibility. The same person, who in health<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
does not start at the firing of a cannon, shall be extremely
disconcerted when sunk by disease to the border of effeminacy,
at the sudden opening of a door. Desire is not always proportioned
to bodily strength: it may sometimes be strongest when
the corporeal strength is at the lowest ebb; it is often found so;
and therefore another reason occurs, why the general use of
Tea ought not to be considered as the most indifferent of all
subjects.</p>

<p>From what has been said upon this subject, it will probably
be admitted, that children and very young persons in general
should be deterred from the use of this infusion. It
weakens their stomachs, impairs the digestive powers, and
favours the generation of many diseases. We seldom perceive
the rudiments of scrophulous diseases so often any where as
in the weak feeble offspring of the inhabitants of towns, and
whose breakfast and supper often consist of the weak runnings
of ordinary Tea, with its usual appurtenances. It ought by no
means to be the common diet of boarding-schools; if it be allowed
sometimes as a treat, the children should at the same
time be informed, that the constant use of it would be injurious
to their health, strength, and constitution in general.</p>

<p class="p1">Thus far I have chiefly endeavoured to trace the effects
of Tea as a part of our diet. In medicine it has at present but
very little reputation amongst us. It is even scarcely ever recommended
as a part of the furniture of a sick chamber; it is
seldom mentioned even as a gentle diaphoretic: in cases, however,
where it is necessary to dilute and relax, to promote the
thinner secretions, it promises at least as much advantage as
most other infusions. For, besides its other effects, it seems to
contain something sedative in its composition (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> II. <span class="smcap">Exp.</span>
III. IV.), not altogether unlike an opiate. Like this class of
medicines, it mitigates uneasiness, perhaps more than any
other merely aqueous infusion: and, like very small doses of
opium, it sometimes prevents rest, and gives a temporary flutter
to the spirits.</p>

<p>Where, therefore, large quantities of the infusion must be
taken, to produce or support a considerable diaphoresis, a decoction
of Tea, or a strong infusion, may be administered with
great propriety, particularly in inflammatory complaints; the
sedative power of Tea, assisted by the diluting effects of warm
water, generally producing a diaphoresis, without stimulating
the system. The Chinese most commonly give it as a medicine
in decoction, in a variety of diseases; but if the infusion were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
drawn from a large proportion of fine Tea, and soon poured off,
that the finest part may be procured, and drank warm, it would
seem preferable as an attenuant and relaxant.</p>

<p>I have more than once given fine green Tea in substance with
some diluting vehicle, and observed the same effects nearly as
are produced from taking the infusion. Thirty grains of this
kind of Tea powdered, taken three or four times at as many
hours interval, generally relaxes the solids, diminishes heat and
restlessness, and induces perspiration. Such a dose as produces
a slight nausea, which this quantity usually does, more certainly
induces a perspiration, and a mitigation of the symptoms accompanying
inflammatory complaints. If this dose be doubled,
the nausea and sickness will be increased, and a disagreeable
sensation or load is felt for some time about the region of the
stomach, which usually goes off with a laxative stool.</p>

<p class="p1">It is said that in Japan and China the stone is a very
unusual distemper, and the natives suppose that Tea has the
quality to prevent it<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. So far as it softens and meliorates the
water, which is very bad, it may certainly be of use<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. We
may also observe here, that every solvent is capable of taking up
a limited quantity only of the solvend, and, when fully saturated
with it, is incapable of suspending it long; hence it is
plain, that the quantity of the stony matter carried off must be
greater when the urine is increased in quantity, and has not
been too long retained in the bladder: and therefore, as Tea is
a diuretic, it may in this view prove lithonthriptic.</p>

<p>Tea, we have already observed, contains an astringent antiseptic
quality (<span class="smcap">Sect.</span> I. <span class="smcap">Exp.</span> I, II.) It likewise possesses no
inconsiderable degree of bitterness; and, as the uvæ ursi, and
other bitters, have mitigated severe paroxysms of the stone, may
not Tea prove serviceable also by its antacid quality?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>It is an observation I have often had occasion to make, that
people, after violent exercise, or coming off a journey much
fatigued, and affected with a sense of general uneasiness, attended
with thirst and great heat, by drinking a few cups of
warm Tea, have generally experienced immediate refreshment.
It also proves a grateful diluent, and agreeable sedative, after a
full meal, when the stomach is oppressed, the head pained, and
the pulse beats high<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; hence the Poet says,</p>

<p class="p1">I shall finish these remarks with some reflections on
this herb, considered in another light.</p>

<p>As luxury of every kind has augmented in proportion to the
increase of foreign superfluities, it has contributed more or less
its share towards the production of those low nervous diseases,
which are now so frequent. Amongst these causes, excess in
spirituous liquors is one of the most considerable; but the first
rise of this pernicious custom is often owing to the weakness
and debility of the system, brought on by the daily habit of
drinking Tea<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>; the trembling hand seeks a temporary relief in
some cordial, in order to refresh and excite again the enfeebled
system; whereby such almost by necessity fall into a habit of
intemperance, and frequently intail upon their offspring a variety
of distempers, which otherwise probably would not have
occurred.</p>

<p>Another bad consequence resulting from the universal custom
of Tea-drinking, particularly affects the poor labouring people,
whose daily earnings are scanty enough to procure them the
necessary conveniences of life, and wholesome diet. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
of these, too desirous of vying with their superiors, and imitating
their luxuries, throw away their little earnings upon this
foreign herb, and are thereby inconsiderately deprived of
the means to purchase proper wholesome food for themselves
and their families. In the words of Persius we may here justly
exclaim,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent0">O curas hominum quantum est in rebus inane!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have known several miserable families thus infatuated,
their emaciated children labouring under various ailments depending
upon indigestion, debility, and relaxation. Some at
length have been so enfeebled, that their limbs have become
distorted, their countenance pale, and a marasmus has closed
the tragedy<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p>These effects are not to be attributed so much to the
peculiar properties of this costly vegetable, as to the want
of proper food, which the expence of the former deprived
these poor people from procuring. I knew a family, confiding
of a mother and several children, whose fondness for
Tea was so great, that three times a day, as often as their
meals, which generally confided of the same articles, they
regularly sent for Tea and sugar, with a morsel of bread to
support nature; by which practice, and the want of a due
quantity of nutritious food, they grew more enfeebled; thin,
emaciated habits and weak constitutions characterised this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
distressed family, till some of the children were removed from
this baneful nursery, by which they acquired tolerable health.</p>

<p>My valuable friend, Dr. Walker, of Leeds, in Yorkshire,
has noticed, in several parts of that extensive and commercial
county, and particularly in Leeds; that, “since the more
plentiful introduction of Tea into the families of the industrious
poor, by the late reduction of its price, the Atrophia Lactantium,
or Tabes Nutricum, a species of decline, has made an
unusually rapid progress. The difficulty with which animal food
is procured by the lower ranks of society, in quantity sufficient
for daily nutriment, has led many of them to substitute, in the
place of more wholesome provisions, a cheap infusion of this
foreign vegetable, whose grateful flavour (and perhaps narcotic
quality, which it possesses in a small degree in common with
most other ever-greens) is found to create an appetite for
itself, in preference to all other kinds of aliment that the scanty
income of poverty allows these deluded objects to procure;
though I am sorry to have occasion to add, that the lowering
effects of tea-drinking lead too many of these to seek relief
from spirits, and other pernicious cordials, at the expence of
health, and the sure consequences of penury and want.</p>

<p>“As this change, in the article of diet, has been very generally
made, especially by the females, and the younger
branches of the families of the manufacturing poor, their
constitutions have been rendered much less able to bear
evacuations of any sort, and particularly that of lactation. I
may, with great truth, aver, that more than two hundred
patients of this denomination have, within the last two years,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
come under my notice: upon their application for relief, and
the consequent enquiry which I have been led to make
respecting the nature of their diet, their almost invariable
reply has been, that they have chiefly depended upon Tea for
their support, at the same time that they were permitting an
apparently healthy child to draw the whole of its nourishment
from them.</p>

<p>“That it is debility, and an impoverished state of the whole
system, arising from a deficiency in the due supply of proper
and sufficiently nutritious aliment, at a time when the constitution
particularly requires it, in consequence of the continual
waste which the mother sustains from the suckling of her infant,
which lay the foundation of this disease, and that the lungs are
but secondarily or symptomatically affected, is clearly evinced
from an attention to the symptoms.</p>

<p>“The patient first complains of languor, and general weakness;
loss of appetite; fatigue after exercise, though it be of the
gentlest kind; wearisome pains in the back and limbs; soon
after which, symptoms of general atrophy come on; the face,
in particular, grows thin, and is marked by a certain delicacy
of complexion; paleness about the nose; but with a small
degree of settled redness in the cheeks. In a short time, if
the patient still continues to give suck, she is seized with
transitory stitches in the sides, under the sternum, or in some
other part of the thorax; accompanied with a short dry cough,
and slight dyspnæa, upon any muscular exertion; the pulse also
becomes frequent, but seldom so hard as in the inflammatory
state of the genuine phthisis pulmonalis; morning sweats next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
make their appearance; abscesses and ulcers are often formed
in the lungs; pus mixed with mucus is expectorated; the
general weakness increases; the emaciated patient is unable
to support an erect posture; and at last dies literally exhausted.”</p>

<p>An ingenious author observes, that as much superfluous money
is expended on Tea and Sugar in this kingdom, as would maintain
four millions more of subjects in bread<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. And the author
of the Farmer’s Letters calculates, that the entertainment of
sipping Tea costs the poor each time as follows:</p>

<p>When Tea is used twice a day, the annual expence amounts
to 7l. 12s. a head. And the same judicious writer estimates
the bread, necessary for a labourer’s family of five persons, at
14l. 15s. 9d. per annum<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. By which it appears, that the
yearly expence of Tea, Sugar, &amp;c. for two persons, exceeds
that of the necessary article of bread, sufficient for a family of
five persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>It appears also, from a moderate calculation, that twenty-one
millions of pounds of Tea<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> are annually imported into England.
In the beginning of the present century the annual
public sales by the East-India Company did not much exceed
50,000 pounds weight, independently of what little might be
clandestinely imported. The Company’s annual sales about this
time, 1797, approach to twenty millions of pounds; being an
increase of four hundred fold in less than 100 years, and answers
to the rate of more than a pound weight each in the
course of the year, for the individuals of all ranks, sexes, and
ages, throughout the British dominions in Europe and America<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>

<p>Since the year 1797, it is probable, that the import of Tea
has increased in a much greater ratio; for the East-India Company,
at their sale in September 1798, put up 1,300,000
pounds of bohea; 3,500,000 pounds of congou and campoi;
400,000 pounds of souchong and pekoe; 600,000 pounds of
singlo and twankay; 400,000 of hyson; hyson skin 100,000;
making, in the whole, 6,300,000 pounds, the quantity sold in
the autumnal quarterly sale: and it may be presumed, from the
table annexed, (<a href="#pg024">p. 1. Section IV.</a>) and other documents, that at
least 30,000,000 of pounds are annually imported into Europe
and America!</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Among several hundred specimens of dried Tea-flowers that I have examined,
scarcely one in twenty was perfect. Some had three petals only, some nine, and others
the several intermediate numbers. The greatest number consisted of six large petals,
and externally three lesser ones of the same form. But the flowers, which blossomed
on the Tea-plant belonging to the duke of Northumberland, from which this description
is taken, consisted in general of six petals. One of the flowers indeed
appeared to have eight petals; however, the number in the flowers in most plants
vary considerably, which may account for the mistake of Dr. Hill, and professor
Linnæus (who described this plant on Dr. Hill’s authority), who make the green and
bohea Tea two distinct species, giving nine petals to the former, and six to the
latter. See Amœn. Acad. Vol. VII. p. 248. Hill. Exot. t. 22. Kæmpfer. Amœn.

that the Tea-trees, he saw in the province of Fokien, did not exceed five or six feet in
height. Journey through the empire of China, London, 1697, 8vo. p. 228. Du Halde

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Osbeck, in his <cite>voyage to China</cite>, speaking of the Camellia, says, “I bought
one of a blind man in the street, which had fine double white and red flowers. But,
by farther observing it in my room, I found that the flowers were taken from another;
and one calyx was so neatly fixed in the other with nails of bamboo, that I
should scarce have found it out, if the flowers had not begun to wither. The tree
itself had only buds, but no open flowers. I learned from this instance, that whoever
will deal with the Chinese, must make use of his utmost circumspection,
and even then must run the risk of being cheated.” Vol. VII. p. 17. Mocquet in
his <cite>Travels and Voyages</cite>, An. 1606, l. 4. p. 264, relates a curious piece of deception
practised by a Chinese of Canton. “A Portuguese,” he says, “bought a roasted
duck at a cook’s shop in Canton. Seeing it look well, and appearing to be very fat,
he carried it with him on-board his vessel, to eat it; but, when he had put his knife
within it to cut it up, he found nothing but the skin, which was upon some paper,
ingeniously fitted up with little sticks, which made up the body of the duck; the
Chinese having very dexterously plucked away the flesh, and then so well accommodated
this skin, that it seemed to be a true duck.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> This writer observes, that the Chinese have also an herb, out of which they
press a delicate juice, which serves them for a drink instead of wine: it also preserves
their health, and frees them from all those evils “that the immediate use of wine
doth breed unto us.” By the use the modern Chinese make of Tea (who are a sober
people) it can be nothing else. Anderson’s <cite>Chronolog. Deduction of Commerce</cite>.</p>

<p>In Renaudot’s<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anciennes Relations</cite>, Paris, 1718, p. 31, mention is made of two
Arabian travellers who visited China about the year 850; and related, that the inhabitants
of that empire had a medicinal beverage, named chah or sah, which was
prepared by pouring boiling water on the dried leaves of a certain herb, which infusion
was reckoned an efficacious remedy in various diseases.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> By an act made this year, the duties of Excise on malt liquor, cyder, perry,
mead, spirits, or strong waters, coffee, tea, sherbet, and chocolate, were settled
on the King during his life. Then it was that Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate, were
first mentioned in the statute book. Noorthouck, in his <cite>History of London</cite>,
remarks, that King Charles II. issued a proclamation for shutting up the coffee-houses,
&amp;c. about a month after he had dined with the Corporation of London, at
Guildhall, on their Lord-Mayor’s day, Oct. 29, 1675. At this feast the King afforded
the Citizens abundant matter for animadversion, in which they indulged
themselves so much to his dissatisfaction, and that of his <em>cabal</em> ministry,
that a proclamation was issued December 20, for shutting up and suppressing
all coffee-houses; “because, in such houses, and by occasion of the meeting of
disaffected persons in them, divers false, malicious, and scandalous reports were
devised and read abroad, to the defamation of his Majesty’s government, and to the
disturbance of the quiet and peace of the realm.” The opinions of the judges were
taken on this great point of stopping people’s tongues, when they sagely resolved,
“that retailing of Coffee and Tea might be an innocent trade; but as it was used to
nourish sedition, spread lies, and scandalize great men, it might also be a common
nuisance.” In short, on a petition of the merchants and retailers of Coffee and Tea,
permission was granted to keep open the coffee-houses until the 24th of June next,
under an admonition, that the masters of them should prevent all scandalous papers,
books, and libels, from being read in them; and hinder every person from declaring,
uttering, or divulging all manner of false or scandalous reports against government or
the ministers thereof. Thus, by a refinement of policy, the simple manufacturer of
a dish of Coffee or Tea was constituted licenser of books, corrector of manners, and
arbiter of the truth or falsehood of political intelligence over every company he entertained!
And here the matter ended. Chap. 15.</p>

<p>In May 1784 an act was passed, called the Commutation Act, “for repealing the
several duties on Tea, and for granting to his Majesty other duties in lieu thereof;
and also several duties on inhabited houses.”</p>

situated. It has been asserted, that no Tea-plants have yet died in England through
excess of cold; but the contrary, I know, has happened. The plant in the
Princess Dowager’s garden at Kew flourished under glass windows, with the
natural heat of the sun, as now do those at Mile-end, in the possession of the
intelligent Botanist J. Gordon. The Tea-plant belonging to Dr. Fothergill thrives
in his garden at Upton, exposed to the open air, and the plant introduced into the

on extensive continents, the degrees of heat and cold are found to be much more
violent than in islands or places bordering on the sea in the same latitude, as the
air that blows over the sea is liable to less variation in these respects, than that
which blows over large tracts of land.</p>

Swedish East-India Company, under the supposition of being Tea-plants, till they
appeared in blossom, when they proved to be this species of Tsubakki, called by
Linnæus, Camellia. Spec. Plant, p. 982. This celebrated Naturalist says, “That the
leaves of his Camellia are so like the true Tea, that they would deceive the most

Plants</cite>, p. 28. A Camellia was brought in 1771 from China in good health; the
leaves of this shrub end in a double obtuse point (obtusely emarginated) like those
of the Tea tree, which makes them still more liable to be mistaken for those of the
latter. Kæmpfer observes, that the leaves of a species of Tsubakki are preserved,
and mixed with Tea, to give it a fine flavour. Amœnit. Exotic. p. 858. It is now

Ellis, F. R. S. &amp;c. in which particular directions are given, both to choose the
proper seeds, and to preserve them in the best manner for vegetation. See also the
Naturalist’s and traveller’s companion, containing instructions for discovering and
preserving objects of natural history, <span class="smcap">Sect.</span> III. We may observe here, that the best
method of bringing over the parts of flowers intire is to put them in bottles of spirit
of wine, good rum, first runnings, or brandy. In the directions, &amp;c. above-mentioned
the learned naturalist has not recommended this easy method of preserving the parts
of fructification; but in a future edition, I am informed he purposes to do it.
Flowers of the Illicium Floridanum, or starry anniseed tree, published in the last
volume of <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite> (LX.) were sent to him in this manner.</p>

<p>In a paper by John Sneyd, Esq. inserted in the <cite>Transactions of the Society for
the Encouragement of Arts</cite>, Vol. XVI. p. 265, a method of preserving seeds is
related, which appears to have been highly successful; this is merely by packing up
seeds in absorbent paper, and surrounding the same by raisins, or brown moist
sugar; which, by experiment, seems to afford that genial moisture requisite to
preserve the seeds in a state fit for vegetation.</p>

<p>Thouin, in his directions to the unfortunate navigator Pèrouse, recommends the
seeds to be placed “in alternate layers of earth or sand, in tin boxes, which must be
closed up exactly, and placed in solid cases, which should be covered with waxed
cloth; the boxes should be put in a part of the ship the least accessible to moisture,
and the most sheltered from extreme heat or cold.” Vol. I. p. 278.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> “The carrying of trees cannot be done, with any hope of success, except in
boxes, wherein they may vegetate during the voyage. For this purpose it is
necessary to have a box forty inches long by twenty broad, and as much in depth,
with a dozen holes bored through the bottom, for the superabundant water to run
off. Its upper part must be composed of a triangular frame, upon which lattice
work of iron wire must be fitted, with glazed frames and window shutters, to keep
up a free circulation of air, encrease the warmth when necessary, and keep out the
cold.” Pèrouse’s <cite>Voyage</cite>, Vol. I. p. 283.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> Another method has succeeded with some North American seeds, by putting
them into a box, not made too close, upon alternate layers of moss, in such a manner
as to admit the seeds to vegetate, or shoot their small tendrils into the moss.
In the passage, the box may be hung up at the roof of the cabin; and, when arrived
here, the seeds should be put into pots of mold, with a little of the moss also
about them, on which they had lain. This method has procured us seeds in a state
fit for vegetation, which had often miscarried under the preceding precautions;
and therefore might be tried at least with Tea and other oriental seeds. In order
to succeed more certainly, some of the Tea seeds, in whatever manner they may have
been preserved, should be sown when the vessel arrives at St. Helena, and also after
passing the tropic of Cancer, near the latitude of 30 degrees North.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> The high price of labour in this country may prove the principal objection
to this prospect. In China provisions are very cheap. Osbeck says, that a workman
who lives upon plucking of Tea-leaves, will scarce be able to get more than
one penny a day, which is sufficient to maintain him. <cite>Voyage to China</cite>, Vol. I.

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> The following extract from Gerard’s Herbal, p. 780. ed. 1636. though
foreign to the subject of this Essay, is so curious, that it may not be deemed improper
to transcribe it. “Potatoes grow in India, Barbarie, Spaine, and other hot
regions, of which I planted diuers rootes (that I bought in the Exchange in London)
in my garden, where they flourished untill winter, at which time they perished and
rotted.” At this date, he adds, “they were roasted in the ashes; some, when
they be so roasted, infuse them, and sop them in wine; and others, to give them
the greater grace in eating, do boile them with prunes, and so eate them. And
likewise others dresse them (being first roasted) with oile, vinegar, and salt, every
man according to his own taste and liking.”</p>

<p>“These rootes (he observes) may serue as a ground or foundation wheron the
cunning confectioner, or sugar-baker, may worke and frame many comfortable
delicate conserves, and restorative sweete meates.”</p>

<p>In 1664 J. Foster published his “<cite>England’s Happyness increased by a Plantation
of Potatoes</cite>,” 4to.</p>

<p>“Captain Hawkins is said to have brought this root from Santa Fè, in New Spain,
A. D. 1565. Sir Walter Rawleigh soon after planted it on his lands in Ireland; but,
on eating the apple, that it produced, which is nauseous and unwholesome, he had
nearly consigned the whole crop to destruction. Luckily the spade discovered the
real potatoe, and the root became rapidly a favourite eatable. It continued, however,
for a long time to be thought rather a species of dainty than of provision;
nor, till the close of the 18th century, was it supposed capable of guarding the
country where it was fostered, from the attacks of famine.” Andrews’s <cite>History</cite>,
Vol. I. p. 408. Comp. Mocquet’s <cite>Travels</cite>, p. 54.</p>

<p>Smelling forcibly at the same has occasioned similar effects upon some delicate
people. Dr Blegny, who wrote in 1680, attributes considerable virtues to this
fragrant odour, which he recommends to be breathed into the lungs, where it acts as
a sedative, according to his own relation, producing sleep, and relieving pains of the
head. Agreeable to Counsellor De Blegny’s experience, I know a lady, frequently
troubled with a nervous <ins class="corr" id="tn-65" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'head-ach'">

from Asia; and the first attempt to cultivate them in Sicily was made about the
middle of the 12th century. From thence they were transplanted into the southern
provinces of Spain. From Spain they were carried to the Canary and Madeira Isles,
and at length into the New World. Ludovico Guicciardini, in enumerating the
goods imported into Antwerp, about the year 1560, mentions the sugar which they
received from Spain and Portugal as a considerable article of import. He describes
that as the product of the Madeira and Canary islands. Deseritt. de Paesi Bassi,
p. 180, 181. The sugar-cane was either not introduced into the West-Indies at that
time, or the cultivation of it was not so considerable as to furnish an article in commerce.
In the middle ages, though Sugar was not raised in such quantities, or
employed for so many purposes, as to become one of the common necessaries of life,
it appears to have been a considerable article in the commerce of the Italian States.”
It is, however, well ascertained, that the Sugar Cane is indigenous to South America,
and the West Indies. Moseley on <cite>Sugar</cite>, p. 29.</p>

who had been troubled for some time with the gravel and stone, and taken many
medicines in vain; till at length he resolved to try the effects of Tea, an account of
which is given by himself in the following words. “I had never used myself to
Tea, so that the drink was new to me. I took a quarter of an ounce of fine bohea
Tea, and, pouring a quantity of boiling water upon it, suffered the infusion to
stand till it grew cold. I then poured it off clear, and drank three cups of it in
the morning, at the distance of about an hour between each, two cups fasting,
one after breakfast, and a fourth two hours after dinner. The first day, the only
effect produced was a more plentiful discharge of urine; but the second day I
voided in the morning twelve large fragments, a nucleus of the size of a small pea,
with some gravel; and what gave me more satisfaction was, that the use of the
Tea kept my body open as in perfect health.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
